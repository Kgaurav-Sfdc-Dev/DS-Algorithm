# Bubble sort is a technique used to sort the DS by swapping adjacent element continiously 
 till  all element in DS become  sorted elememt.
 
 
 # Sorting helps in solving many logical questions 
 1. largest number in an array 
 2 . second largest in an array 
 3. and so many 
 
 
 
 # Algoritm of bubble sort 
 
 1. take the give array 
 2. algorithm will compare the adjacent element  and chages the Position accordingly
 3. it will break the array to two parts ie. sorted array and unsorted array 
 4. in each iteration one largest element will go and sit to the right of array (sorted part of array )
 
 
  --
 outer loop :-in each execution it will send the largest element to the right most right of array 
              (sorted Part of the array ) and leave that index for later execution 
               i=0 to i=6 ;
               aafter one execution it leave last i=6 
               and become i=0 to i=5; 
               because the element at i=6 is correct element after First execution 
 
 inner loop :- it will just compare the adjacent elemt and swap them
 for(int i=arr.length-1;i>0;i--)
 {

 for(int j=0;j<i;j++)
 {
  //swapping code 
 
 }
 }
